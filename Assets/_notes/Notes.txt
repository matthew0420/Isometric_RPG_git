Inverse Kinematics:
    -procedural animations
    Setup: 
        -rig builder attached to root gameobject along with animator component
            -bone hierarchy and armature are a collection of bones, child of root
        -custom rigs for each IK setup we want, children of root
        Example:
            Target Tracking Rig:
                -Head Constraint
            Climbing Rig:
                -arm constraints
                -leg constraints
    This setup will override keyframe values of pre-made animations as needed
